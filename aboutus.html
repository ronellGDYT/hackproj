        <p>In 2010, Detroit had a population of 713,000 with over 20,000 people being homeless. Now we estimate that at least 11,701 people are still homeless 12 years later. This slow descent is not due to rehabilitation granted by the state of Michigan or the city of Detroit, but instead from the steadily growing death toll caused by the neglect of the less fortunate. Without sugar coating, the city of Detroit has done a poor job at providing resources for the homeless, especially during the winter and the last 3 years with the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p> Shelters are kept unclean and are often overbooked or have unrealistic criterias to gain entree. This leaves thousands of people left with no access to shelter from the deadly winters and the scorching summers that affect Detroit. Additionally, with no reasonable resources to help those with a drug history, criminal backgrounds, or lack of education, these people are left to rot where they indulge in self-destructive behavior; putting them lower and lower on this metaphorical totem that we call society where they become invisible people; where everybody knows they are there but only a few choose to acknowledge them. </p>
        <p>Will you join those few? Meet Journi Housing and Care. We created this website in mind of what's stated above to act as a beginning point for easy access to resources for people who are less fortunate and do not have suitable living accommodation and give access to resources that can be useful to anyone with no bias to color, race, sex, or age. We link resources to nonprofit organizations that can not just help those in need in the present but set them up with the foundation to excel in the future. These include but are not limited to food banks, highly rated homeless shelters, drug rehabilitation facilities, etc. </p>
